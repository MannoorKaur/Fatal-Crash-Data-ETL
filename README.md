# Graph Database Design Report: Road Crash Fatality Analysis #

This project presents a comprehensive graph database design for analyzing road crash fatality data. By leveraging graph database technology, we model complex relationships between crashes, vehicles, persons, locations, and environmental factors to enable advanced analytics and pattern discovery in traffic safety research.
